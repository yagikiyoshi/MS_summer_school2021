# Molecular Science Summer School 2021

This is an on-line material of my lectures in molecular science summer school 2021.
The lecture is aimed at those who are interested in computational chemistry, and 
want to develop the skills to perform electronic structure calculations and 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

- Electronic structure calculations using [Gaussian16](https://gaussian.com/)
  -  3.1. Basic: Water molecule
  -  3.2. ESP surface of imidazole
  -  3.3. Excited states of rhodamine 

- MD simulations using [GENESIS](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/)
  -  5.1. Basic MD: Protein G

- QM/MM calculations using [GENESIS](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/) and [DFTB+](https://dftbplus.org/)
  -  7.1. QM/MM-MD: Phosphate ion in solution 

- Vibrational calculations using [SINDO](https://tms.riken.jp/en/research/software/sindo/)
  -  9.1. VCI and VQDPT2 with multi-resolution PES: Formaldehyde
  -  9.2. VQDPT2 with local modes: Water trimer and hexamer
  -  9.3. VQDPT2 with QM/MM potential: Phosphate ion in solution
