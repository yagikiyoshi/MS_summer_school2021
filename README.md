# Molecular Science Summer School 2021

This is an on-line material of my lectures in molecular science summer school 2021.
The lecture is aimed at those who are interested in computational chemistry, and 
want to develop the skills to perform electronic structure calculations and 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

- Electronic structure calculations using Gaussian16
  -  3.1. Basic: Water molecule
  -  3.2. ESP surface of imidazole
  -  3.3. Excited states of rhodamine using TD-DFT

- MD simulations using [GENESIS](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/)
  -  5.1. Basic MD: Protein G

- QM/MM calculations
  -  7.1. QM/MM-MD of a phosphate ion in solution using [GENESIS](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/) and [DFTB+](https://dftbplus.org/)

- Vibrational calculations using [SINDO](https://tms.riken.jp/en/research/software/sindo/)
  -  9.1. VSCF, VCI, VQDPT2 applied to formaldehyde
